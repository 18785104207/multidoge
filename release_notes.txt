MultiDoge release notes:

23 Feb 2014: 0.1.1
+ Saves window state on close so size and position are restored at launch.
+ Option to minimize to tray. Stays in dock on OS X because Apple has no API to change that dynamically. On Linux the icon lacks transparanecy due to an internal Java bug. Sorry, can't change that :/
+ Only allow nodes with more than 105000 blocks to connect. Prevents running on the wrong side of the recent fork.
+ Remove blockchain.info wallet import (leftover)
+ Only allow .wallet files to imported. Prevents users from trying to open .dat files.
+ Update Japanese translation
#2: Switched to BitcoinAverage as BTC/fiat rate provider
#5: Update French transaltion
#7: Allow parallel running of MultiBit and MultiDoge
#10: Fix "BTC" leftover in transaction details
